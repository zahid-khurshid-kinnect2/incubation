                    <h2>How are we different?
                        IIC’s Roadmap</h2>

                    <p>For applied research to be commercialized, it is essential that the faculty and students have the entrepreneurial orientation. Not all of the academic staff has entrepreneurial disposition. Therefore, to develop a culture of entrepreneurship within the university, IIC is: Holding seminars and workshops to acquaint the faculty and students on entrepreneurship and its benefits for personal and national development. These workshops and seminars are conducted by industry professionals and academic experts (national and international). Providing entrepreneurial skills training to graduates and faculty interested in entrepreneurial activities. These skills training workshops would focus on specialized skills needed for start-ups. These training workshops would help develop positive attitude among faculty and students regarding entrepreneurship. Holding business idea competitions across different departments in the university. These completions would not only inculcate the entrepreneurial spirit but would also bring out creativity among the faculty and students. These competitions would mainly focus on technology oriented ideas and can be either sole departmental in origin or cross departmental. 4. Hold exhibitions of innovations and technologies developed within the university premises for various industries. These exhibitions would help foster industry linkages and help in provision of funding from the relevant industries. 5. Develop collaborative networks with national and international organizations and universities. These networks will help nascent entrepreneurs to access information as well as markets for their innovations.

                    <h2>How we define</h2>

                    <h3>Innovation</h3>

                        Innovation is referred to as the process of translating an idea or invention into a product or service (tangible or intangible) that creates value for which customer will pay. To be called an innovation in business sense, an idea must be feasible at an economic cost. For deeper understanding in business context, innovation involves intentional use of information, imagination and initiative in delivering greater value, which must be able to differentiate from existing alternatives.

                        <h3>Incubation</h3>

                        Business incubation is an important mechanism to support growth-oriented entrepreneurs. There are thousands of business incubators around the world working in very different environments with a wide variety of aims and missions. Business incubation, for example, can be mainly focused on fostering entrepreneurship in general (mixed-used incubation), or in specific areas like tourism or handicraft businesses. It can also concentrate on specific technologies or industries, like agribusiness, information & communication technologies, climate change or biotechnology

                    <h3>Incubation Center</h3>

                        Business Incubator Centers are specialized centers in which entrepreneurs can receive pro-active, value-added support, and access to critical tools, information, education, contacts, resources and capital that may otherwise be unaffordable, inaccessible or unknown. Well-structured incubators provide links to industry; business support services to enhance and develop business; upgrade skills and techniques; technological advice and assistance with intellectual property protection; financial resources for R&D; initial marketing expenses; and access to potential private investors and strategic partners. The incubation centers established within university campuses are important source of entrepreneurial activities and technological developments. The incubation process helps in diagnosis and treatment of business problems helping in lowering the early stage failure of technologically oriented entrepreneurial ventures. Such incubators help in developing skills required to start and manage a new entrepreneurial ventures and make them sustainable. The university incubators normally target graduates who want to start their own businesses, and those who would like to further develop their talent and ideas and take them towards commercialization.

                        <h3>Academic Commercialization</h3>

                        Commercialization in its entirety means to use, apply, publish, manufacture, assign, license, sublicense, franchise, sell, exploit, market, or otherwise use or dispose of the IP for the purpose of generating financial or other commercial returns. In the same spirit, academic commercialization relates to exploitation of university intellectual property for commercial use. The academic commercialization refers to transfer of university based knowledge and technology to industrial organizations either through spin-off formation, in which new start-up companies are created by the inventors (with university support) for further development of the invention (prototype), or existing companies are given licensing for its use.

                            <h3>Startup</h3>

                        Any new company working to unravel a problem where the solution is not evident and success is not guaranteed is known as a startup. The aim of a startup venture is not to maintain its sustainability but the culture of the company is to forgo steadiness and evolve constantly to seek tremendous growth. Startup of the contemporary business world vary a lot as revenues, profits and employment numbers change significantly between companies and industries. Further the culture of these organizations do not follow the pre-established norms and even a bunch of hoddie wearing employees working in small space can be termed as a startup if it is doing some serious work to address an important problem present in the market or is catering the needs of the target market.
